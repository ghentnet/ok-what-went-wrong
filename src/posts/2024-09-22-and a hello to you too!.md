The good news is that my desk is fully set up for recording now!

Addressing the next steps:

Networking honestly scares me, so I’m probably not going to be able to help a whole lot here aside from the grunt work of running commands on the boxes.

That being said, I think that setting up a second LAN specifically for homelab with it’s own router should work to solve out IP issues. It feels like a very brute force and kludgy way of handling it, but its straight forward and, as I said, networking scares me.

Decommissioning the “outside” server is in our best interest in my opinion. I agree fully that the traffic we’re expecting isn’t going to be great enough that we’re gonna need that extra bandwidth that the external hosting is gonna provide us. Additionally, if the Matrix server goes down and we lose the data and then have to start from zero, I think we’ll be good. Nobody has mission critical data on there, and the setting up process won’t be headache inducing.

Side note about GoToSocial, I want to be more involved in that setup this time. I need to know how to control the server configuration if I’m going to continue to use the platform. [^1]

I’m in the dark mostly about how to setup things, so I’ll need to take marching orders, but I’m ready to work on this!
